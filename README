Credits to https://github.com/akechi-haruka/SuperMonkeyLEDs for the jvs parsing and led commands stuff.
Tested to work in Chunithm, ONGEKI and APM3.
In config.h you can setup a per baord offset for example if you jsut want the air leds for Chunithm.
Default led pins is 2 for strip 1 and pin 3 for strip 2.
So for example left air pin 2 and right air pin 3.
It exposes itself as 2 serial interfaces.
